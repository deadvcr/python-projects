Zips and copies all map files from the Minecraft folder to the web server directory where they can be accessed and downloaded. 

Perhaps someday I'll add FTP support, but for now I don't need it. If you want to use it, simply add the location of the map folder to the "worldList" list
and the name of the map to the "worldName" list and run it. If you're using it on a server I suggest using screen.

You'll also have to change all the paths yourself.
